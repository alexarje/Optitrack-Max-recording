# Optitrack-Max-recording

Setup for random playback of sound stimuli, triggered from an Optitrack motion capture system

The patch listens to the sound from the Optitrack machine, and starts the experiment when the "pling" from the Optitrack recording has started. 

## How to use

1. Connect the sound output from the Optitrack PC to the input of the PC running the Max patch
2. Put the sound files to use in the same folder as the patch
3. Modify the coll in the patch to match the names of sound files to use
4. Turn on audio in the patch
5. Start motion capture in the Optitrack software
